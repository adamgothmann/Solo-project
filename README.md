# Fantasy Draft Tool

Fantasy Draft Tool is a web app that can be used for offline fantasy football drafts. The idea behind it was to replace the frustrating process of drafting with pen and paper.

To use the app, you can either use the provided player rankings from the "Fantasy Data" API, or if you would like to create your own player rankings, click the "add" button next to each player. Once the draft starts, As players are drafted, click the "remove" button to remove them from the list of available players. When it is your turn to draft, click the "draft" button, and they will appear on your team.

Technologies used: PostgreSQL, JavaScript, AngularJS, Express.js, Node.js, Git.
